* Tilde in top left
* ESC/CTRL where CAPSLOCK usually is ("vim style", though I'm not a huge vim user).
* FN1 in bottom left corner.
* FN1 + CAPSLOCK is actual CAPSLOCK
* Then ALT and SUPER (Mac layout)
* After spacebar is FN1, SUPER/Fn2, ALT, CTRL
* Bottom right corner short-press is arrows (a la Anne Pro 2)
* Note: Karabiner messes with capslock state - not a bug in qmk, affects all keyboards
